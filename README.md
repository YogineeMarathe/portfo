**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for cloud architects who are responsible for designing and managing cloud solutions with GCP. You'll also find the book useful if you're a system engineer or enterprise architect looking to learn how to design solutions with Google Cloud. Moreover, cloud architects who already have experience with other cloud providers and are now beginning to work with Google Cloud will benefit from the book. Although an intermediate-level understanding of cloud computing and distributed apps is required, prior experience of working in the public and hybrid cloud domain is not mandatory.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
